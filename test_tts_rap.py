Yo, check it, we testing the TTS flow
Making sure the rhythm and the beat can go
With artificial voices spitting fire like this
OpenAI TTS putting rap to the test, never miss

Every word hitting hard with lyrical vision
From CEO to consultant, nobody's safe
When the AI starts rapping, it's sealing their fate
